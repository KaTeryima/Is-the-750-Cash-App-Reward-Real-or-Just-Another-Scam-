## My Experience

I decided to give it a try to see if it was worth it. I signed up on Flash Rewards and started completing deals. Some were easy, like taking surveys, but others required me to sign up for free trials and you should remember to cancel them later. It took me about a 7 days  to complete all the required deals. In the end, I did receive my reward. I must say it was a bit fun for me because I didn't really have much to do all day. So completing some task like sign ups and surveys was not bad.
